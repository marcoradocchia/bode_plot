# AUTOMATIC TRANSFER FUNCTION ACQUISITION
Scripts for automatic transfer function acquisition on Diligent Studio

## Requirements:
* __Diligent WaveForms__
* __Diligent Adept Runtime__ (only Linux)
* __Python 3__: in case you're using these scripts on windows you need to add it to Path in Environment Variables section; should be already installed on Linux
* __TEX distribution__ (tested using TeX Live)
* __GhostScript__: required by 'matplotlib' in order to work with LaTeX; should be already installed on Linux


## Important:
* Careful! The scripts are not working on _Python 2_
* Please don't apply any changes to the .dwf3work files! They contain a script that runs the data acquisition.

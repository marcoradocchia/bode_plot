# AUTOMATIC TRANSFER FUNCTION ACQUISITION
Scripts for automatic transfer function acquisition on Diligent Studio

## Requirements:

	* _Diligent WaveForms_
	* _Diligent Adept Runtime_ (only Linux)
	* _Python 3_: in case you're using these scripts on windows you need to add it to Path in Environment Variables section; should be already installed on Linux
	* _TEX distribution_ (tested using TeX Live)
	* _GhostScript_: required by 'matplotlib' in order to work with LaTeX; should be already installed on Linux


## Important:

	* Careful! The scripts are not working on __Python 2__
	* Please don't apply any changes to the .dwf3work files! They contain a script that runs the data acquisition.
